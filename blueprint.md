# Blueprint: Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview

A personal portfolio website to showcase my projects and skills. The website will have a modern, dark theme with a glitch effect for the main heading. It will be a single-page application with sections for Home, Projects, and Contact.

## Project Outline

*   **Initial Setup:** Create a multi-page website with a home page, a projects page, and a contact page, all wrapped in a single, consistent layout for a seamless user experience.
*   **Modern Design:** Implement a sleek, dark-themed design with a glitch text effect for headings, custom fonts, and a professional color scheme that ensures your portfolio is both beautiful and easy to navigate.
*   **Interactive Elements:** To make your site dynamic and engaging, I will add icons, social media links, and a functional contact form, creating an interactive experience for your visitors.
